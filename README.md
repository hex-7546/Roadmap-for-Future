# Roadmap for Future

# Systems Programming and Distributed System üíª‚öôÔ∏è

This repo contains the roadmap for my future in computer science. I've chosen <b>SYSTEMS PROGRAMMING</b> and <b>DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS</b>. I've chosen this because of my interest in hardware, cutting edge technologies and scalable infrastructures

## Fundamentals concepts
It covers the following core concepts of computer sciemce:

1. <b>Operating Systems</b>
    - Processes
    - Threads (User and Kernel Level)
    - Memory Management
    - Virtual Memory
    - Concurrent Programming
    - Synchronization

2. <b>Computer Networks</b>
    - OSI Model
    - TCP/IP Model

3. <b>Database Systems and ACID Properties</b>
    - ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability)
    - SQL Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
    - NoSQL Databases (Cassandra, DynamoDB)
    - Single-node systems

4. <b>Algorithms</b>
    - Scheduling algorithms (Operating Systems)
        - First Come, First Served (FCFS)
        - Shortest Job First (SJF)
        - <b>>Round Robin (RR)</b>
        - Priority Scheduling 
        - Real-time Scheduling
    
    - Data Structure Algorithms (Database Systems)
        - B-Tree Operations
        - Insertion Algorithm
        - Range Query Optimization
    
    - Sorting Algorithms
        - Merge Sort
        - Quick Sort

    - Distributed Systems Algorithms
        - Consensus Algorithm
        - Paxos Algorithm
        - <b>Raft Algorithm</b>

    - Graph Algorithms
        - Dijkstra's Algorithm
        - Bellman Ford Algorithm

    - Load Balancing Algorithms


## Steps to take

### 1. Understanding the fundamentals concepts (OS, CN, DB, CP)
### 2. Languages to learn (C, RUST, GO)
### 3. Connecting every fundamental concept and create projects accordingly

## Small Projects:
- Building an HTTP server
- Implementing basic networking protocols

## Large Projects (will choose one of them)
- Building scalable backend infrastructure
- High performance database engines
- Scientific computing or parallel processing
- Creating performance benchmarking tools
- Building a messaging system
